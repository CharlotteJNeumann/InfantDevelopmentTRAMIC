This is a repository containing background data for the TRAMIC infant development project.

## Publications
The manuscripts is available as a preprint on BioRxiv: "First-Year Dynamics of the Anaerobic Microbiome and Archaeome in Infantsâ€™ Oral and Gastrointestinal Systems" Neumann et al 2024 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.07.24.604926v1

Additionally, the manuscript is under review at mSystems at the moment.

##Structure

Therfore, 16S rRNA sequencing data (universal and archaea specific) as well as metagenomic data were analyzed.
